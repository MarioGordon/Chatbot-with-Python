If you look carefully at the json file, you can see that there are sub-objects within objects. For example, “patterns” is an attribute within “intents”. So we will use a nested for loop to extract all of the words within “patterns” and add them to our words list. We then add to our documents list each pair of patterns within their corresponding tag. We also add the tags into our classes list, and we use a simple conditional statement to prevent repeats.
